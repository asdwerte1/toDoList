# Simple To Do List
A simple to do list I created and now use for tracking my tasks
## Technologies
### Front End
* Bootstrap 5
* AJAX
* Google Fonts - Kode Mono
### Back end
* PHP
* SASS
* MySQL

The list is set to auto cap at 10 items - to prevent excessive active jobs and excessive traffic

## Next features
* Add functionality to sort tasks based on date, priority etc
* Create a login feature to allow scope for multiple users with their own lists
